# GrooveLab

This project is entirely made with Meta SDK. It pushes the boundaries of the SDK, diving deep into functionalities such as Passthrough, hand tracking, ray interactions, poke interactions, controller input, buttons, curved UIs, and C# scripts It's not just a drum app; it's a showcase of Meta's potential for intuitive MR interactions and immersive design. Every tap, poke, and swipe feels intuitive, creating a drum kit so believable you'll forget it's virtual.
